For the course DoD, include pasteable terminal output (or screenshots) that demonstrates:

1. **EC2**: `create` (shows AMI resolution and instance id), `list`, `start`, `stop`.
2. **S3**: `create` (private), `create` (public with confirmation), `upload` to a CLI-created bucket, `list`.
3. **Route53**: `create-zone`, `record create`, and `list` showing the record.
