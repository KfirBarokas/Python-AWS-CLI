user needs to install aws cli 
install boto3
install tabulate
install argparse ? (maybe it comes by default)
run python venv using "source .venv/Scripts/activate"

For the course DoD, include pasteable terminal output (or screenshots) that demonstrates:

1. **EC2**: `create` (shows AMI resolution and instance id), `list`, `start`, `stop`.
2. **S3**: `create` (private), `create` (public with confirmation), `upload` to a CLI-created bucket, `list`.
3. **Route53**: `create-zone`, `record create`, and `list` showing the record.

If you implemented the optional UI, include one screenshot and short steps describing how to run it.


TODOs:
- delete bucket and content?
- add screenshots to docs
- check clean install on ec2 
- add install instructions






Done:
- output to user 
- check which python version is compatible 3.10+
- add to docs which OSs are compatible 
- Put developer username in tags?
